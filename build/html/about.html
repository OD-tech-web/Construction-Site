            <h2>About Frank Nnaneme</h2>
            <p class="mg-t">Frank Nnaneme began his life-long career in construction very early when working over his
                high school
                summer
                vacations in as an apprentice to both his father as well as his uncle. His father led his own concrete
                and
                framing company and his uncle specialized as an electrical and plumbing contractor. Frank worked hard and
                passionately to learn as much as he could from his mentors and eventually became a foreman for both His
                father and uncle's company.
            </p>
            <p class="mg-t">During his many years as foreman, Frank constantly encounted people who were in desperate
                need of a
                reliable,
                ethical and efficient general contractor. After hearing endless stories of unfortunate experiences
                homeowners had with contractors, Frank was motivated and encouraged to attend school and become Licensed.
